# Next.js starter

## Getting started

- Clone the project

- Go to the project directory

```bash
cd path_to_the_project
```

- Install dependencies (note: this project uses `npm`)
```bash
npm install
```

- Run project locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

## This starter has the following technologies:
- Typescript - typed programming language üôÇ‚ú®
- Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework 
- Prettier An opinionated code formatter with my opinion of how should the code formatted
- Eslint - Nextjs basic eslint (you can edit as your necessities)

## Things to have in mind

`<Head>` element: You can apply to any of your pages and edit some props (remember to change hardcoded things, like the `URL`)

`<Page>` element: You can wrap with this element all your pages to omit repeated code, you can add more things to that element, such as a Footer, etc.

Remove hardcoded things in `_document.tsx` file for example og:image, etc.

And last but not least, remember to change the name of the package.json :).


### Motivations: 

I made it because every time I start a new project I need to think about this, if you like, you can contribute by adding or changing things to the starter. Hope you like it.
